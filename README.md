# SteamVRVersion
 
A personal copy of the Robotics Academy v1.0 software.

This project is a National Science Foundation funded project to research how Virtual Reality affects how long is takes to learn to control industrial robots.
It uses SteamVR along with MRTK and RoboDK to allow the user to manipulate KUKA Robot models in realistic ways.

This repository no longer receives development since we began creating Robotics Academy v2.0

Here is a demo of this project
